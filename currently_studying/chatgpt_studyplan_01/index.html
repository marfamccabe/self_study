            <p>My go-to order from my favorite coffee shop is a matcha latte. Coffee has its moments, but a bright, vibrant matcha always hits the spot. Hot or iced, matcha lattes are perfect any time of day. I personally love one with oat milk and just a touch of vanilla or lavender syrup.</p>

            <p>If you've never had a matcha latte, it's worth the hype. Some people don't like the grassy taste, but that just means it's high quality tea! Some benefits of drinking matcha are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>High in antioxidants, which support the immune system</li>
                <li>Enhances mood & focus without the jitters</li>
                <li>Helps detoxify the body</li>
            </ul>
